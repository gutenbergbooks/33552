FOREWORD
</H3>

<P>
Poetry has been defined as "Thought touched by Emotion," and I know no
better working definition, although no doubt more scientific and
accurate ones could be found.  The best poets of all ages seem to have
had this ideal plainly before them, whether consciously or
unconsciously, and I cannot see how modern poets can dispense with
either thought or emotion if they are to write real poetry.  For one is
not enough without the other.  Take for example the first lines of
Master's "Spoon River Anthology."
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Where are Elmer, Herman, Bert, Tom and Charley,<BR>
The weak of will, the strong of arm, the clown, the boozer, the fighter?<BR>
All, all, are sleeping on the hill,<BR>
One passed in a fever,<BR>
One was buried in a mine,<BR>
One was killed in a brawl,<BR>
One died in a jail,<BR>
One fell from a bridge toiling for children and wife,<BR>
All, all are sleeping on the hill."<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
This sounds tragic indeed, but seems to have aroused no emotion on the
part of the poet and excites none in his readers.  In fact, through the
whole poem, emotion is held in check with a strong hand, and only
allowed to show itself in some distorted cynicism.
</P>

<P>
Let us take an example of the opposite extreme where emotion, whether
real or fancied, has stifled thought.
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O World!  O Men!  O Sun! to you I cry,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">I raise my song defiant, proud, victorious,</SPAN><BR>
And send this clarion ringing down the sky:<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">"I love, I love, I love, and Love is glorious!"</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
The definition chosen need not hamper the most "modern" poet nor
restrict his choice of subject, for there are few things that cannot
awaken both thought and emotion if looked at in the right way.  An iron
foundry and a Venetian palace have immense possibilities of arousing
both elements, and perhaps the foundry has the greater power.
</P>

<P>
The modern poet has joined the great army of seekers after freedom,
that is, he refuses to observe the old conventions in regard to his
subjects and his method of treating them.  He refuses to be bound by
the old restrictions of rhyme and metre, and goes far afield in search
of material on which to work.  The boldest of the new school would
throw overboard all the old forms and write only in free verse, rythmic
prose or whatever he may wish to call it.  The conservative, on the
other hand, clings stubbornly to the old conventions, and will have
nothing to do with vers libre or anything that savours of it.
</P>

<P>
But vers libre, like the motor-car and aeroplane, has come to stay
whether we like it or no.  It is not really a new thing, although put
to a new use, for some of the greatest poetry of the Hebrews and other
Oriental nations was written in a form of free verse.  At the present
time the number of those using it as medium of expression is steadily
increasing.  In France, Italy, the United States, and even in
conservative England, the increase in the number of poems recently
published in this form has been remarkable.  The modernists hail this
tendency as the dawn of a new era of freedom, while the conservatives
see poetry falling into decadence and ruin.  The right view of the case
probably lies, as it generally does, between the extremes.  There is
much beauty to be found in walking in beaten paths or rambling in
fenced-in fields and woods, but perhaps one who sails the skies in an
aeroplane may see visions and feel emotions that never come to those
who wander on foot along the old paths of the woods and fields below.
</P>

<P>
But it seems to me that it matters little in what form a poem is cast
so long as the form suits the subject, and does not hinder the freedom
of the poet's thought and emotion.  And I am old-fashioned enough to
expect that beauty will be revealed as well.  Out of this union of
thought, emotion and beauty, we could scarcely fail to get strength
also, which term many modern poets use to cover an ugliness that is
often nothing but disguised weakness.  But form alone will not make
even a semblance of poetry as the following lines, unimpeachable in
form, from Sir Walter Scott plainly show:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Then filled with pity and remorse,<BR>
He sorrowed o'er the expiring horse."<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Nor can I conceive of more beautiful poetry than the following, by
Richard Aldington, although rhyme and regular metre are absent:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"And we turn from the music of old,<BR>
And the hills that we loved and the meads,<BR>
And we turn from the fiery day,<BR>
And the lips that were over-sweet;<BR>
For silently<BR>
Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,<BR>
With purple robe<BR>
Searing the grass as with a sudden flame,<BR>
Death,<BR>
Thou hast come upon us."<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
And this brings me to the real purpose of this Foreword&mdash;the
explanation of the title of this book.  On the hills and plains of
Southern Europe there grows a plant with beautiful indented leaves&mdash;the
Acanthus.  The Greek artist saw the beauty of these leaves, and, having
arranged and conventionalized them, carved them upon the capitals of
the columns which supported the roofs and pediments of his temples and
public buildings.  Since that time, wherever pillars are used in
architecture, one does not have far to look to find acanthus leaves
carved upon them.  In the Roman Forum, in Byzantine churches like Saint
Sophia or Saint Mark's, in the Mediæval Cathedrals of France.  England
and Spain, in the Renaissance buildings scattered throughout the world,
and even in the most modern office-buildings of our great cities, this
decoration of acanthus is to be found.  And the reason is not far to
seek.
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"A thing of beauty ... will never<BR>
Pass into nothingness."<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
I recently saw a picture of a Corinthian column of a ruined Greek
temple standing against the sky, and broken fragments of its fellows
lying at its foot, with wild vines climbing over them.  And who could
say that one was more beautiful than the other?  The carved acanthus
leaves upon the column were beautiful because of their symmetry,
harmony of light and shade and clear-cut outline, but the wild grape
was perhaps more beautiful still in its natural freedom.
</P>

<P>
So in this little book will be found some poems in the old conventional
forms and some others in free rhythms, in which the author has tried in
a humble way, to mingle elements of thought, emotion and beauty.

Old  gods are dead; their broken shrines are lying<BR>
Profaned with blood and trampled to the ground;<BR>
I see lost beauty with each sunset dying,<BR>

O sun-browned boy with the wondering eyes,<BR>
Do you see the blue of the summer skies?<BR>
Do you hear the song of the drowsy stream,<BR>
As it winds by the shore where the birches gleam?<BR>
Then come, come away<BR>

Came pirates bold,<BR>
With a Spanish galleon's captured gold;<BR>
And their boat was wrecked on the river strand,<BR>
And its treasures strewn on the silver sand.<BR>

'Neath its foam-flecked brim,<BR>

Such a glittering store<BR>

He rose and vanished in the blue.<BR>

White birches danced in frills of green,<BR>
And all the world was mad with spring.<BR>

The bluebird's wing was dull and gray.<BR>

leaves of the crumbling columns,<BR>

The wild bees hum and buzz<BR>
Among the grape-flowers, heavy with honeyed perfume,<BR>
Under the drowsy noonday sun,<BR>
That spills its amber wine from a full goblet over the thirsting hillside.<BR>
Wanton and wild,<BR>

Clinging to the breast of his dead mistress,<BR>
The vine clings in voluptuous embrace<BR>
About the naked, pallid forms,<BR>

Of youth and age<BR>

As of playing of distant pipes<BR>
By slender shepherd lads among the hills.<BR>
Then I turned away from the shore<BR>
And I saw the pediment of a great temple<BR>
Standing white against the sky,<BR>
And beneath the pediment rows of marble columns<BR>
Like giant trees in a forest of frozen beauty.<BR>
Statues gleamed amid the dark foliage of cypress and olive trees,<BR>
Statues of gods and goddesses, youths and maidens,<BR>
Horses of ruddy bronze and chariots of beaten brass.<BR>
My feet trod the steps of the marble stairway,<BR>
